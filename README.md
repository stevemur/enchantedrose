The Enchanted Rose is a prop with a Raspberry Pi Zero W base. 

To build new versions, use a Next.js development environment. Make changes locally and make sure they run on your local machine. 

Then do a
```next build```
This will generate an ```out``` subfolder on your machine.
Connect into the Raspberry Pi via Filezilla (use "root" as the username and the admin password.) Copy the output files into the folder
```\var\www\html```
